# GenhancerMoreAudioSamples

This repo holds more audio samples beyond the [demo page](https://sophieymie.github.io/) of paper <i>Genhancer: High-Fidelity Speech Enhancement via Generative Modeling on Discrete Codec Tokens</i>

10 first samples (gender balanced) from each evaluation set of five variants of Genhancer are included.

For a closer comparison between models and supplementary materials, go to [demo page](https://sophieymie.github.io/).
